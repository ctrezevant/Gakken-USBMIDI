# Documentation

Here you'll find some cool/useful documentation!

First, you'll find a scan of the user manual/magazine which first introduced the SX-150. While this is for the Mk 1, the first and second models appear to be closely technically related, and it has other useful information inside.

The included schematic is from the first prototype version of the synth, and is apparently more or less
congruent with what you'll find in the actual production unit.

Also included is a wiring diagram for the MCP4921. This DAC is what's used to generate a control voltage for the Gakken, and speaks
to the Arduino over SPI. The diagram has been sourced from [MrBook's original blog post](http://mrbook.org/blog/2008/11/22/controlling-a-gakken-sx-150-synth-with-arduino/). I've also included a copy of the MCP4921 datasheet, which was was originally sourced from [Microchip's site](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/21897b.pdf).
