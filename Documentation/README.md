# Documentation

Here you'll find some cool/useful documentation!

First, you'll find a scan of the user manual/magazine which first introduced the SX-150. While this is for the Mk 1, the first and second models appear to be closely technically related, and it has other useful information inside.

The included schematic is from the first prototype version of the synth, and is apparently more or less
congruent with what you'll find in the actual production unit.

Also useful is the following blog post from Gan (@naokiiwakami), who designed the SX-150 Mk 1 & 2: http://gaje.jp/2011/10/09/2384/
